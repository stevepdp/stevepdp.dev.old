Made in approximately one hour for <a href="https://onehourgamejam.com/?page=jam&jam=326" rel="noopener" target="_blank">One Hour Game Jam</a> with the theme "Virtual Pet".

### Retrospective

#### One Hour Game Jam
Second time participating in this jam.

When comparing this to the last submission, you can see my one hour prototyping ability has improved.

The game features a little narrative, a little more gameplay and two possible outcomes. I'm pleased with it given the time limit and that it got a laugh on the Twitch stream.


#### About The Game

It's a clean-em-up.

Cyber pets require you to periodically clean the screen. It's what came to mind when the theme was announced.

To play you simply need to collide with the poops that spawn.
