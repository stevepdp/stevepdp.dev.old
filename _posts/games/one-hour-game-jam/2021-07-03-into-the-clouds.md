### Retrospective
Made for <a href="https://onehourgamejam.com/?page=jam&jam=323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Hour Game Jam</a> with the theme "Clouds".


#### About The Game
Given that development time is so limited, you really have to go with the first thing that comes to mind. With "clouds" in mind, it was a childhood memory. As a child I would often hang on to climbing frame rails, look into the sky and fear falling into it.

So in the game you're hanging on to a rail and coins spawn along it. You must move left/right to collect the coins before they disappear. If you don't, you'll fall in!


#### Jamming in One Hour
I've been aware of One Hour Game Jam for a few years, but only recently have I felt the confidence to try it.

Despite it actually taking me 1 hour and 15 minutes to design, build and publish, I'm happy with the result. I published the Windows build on Itch in time for the Twitch stream. I then spent a few minutes post-stream tidying up the descriptions and shipping a WebGL build.

Every decision you make during One Hour Game Jam has a measurable impact. Hit play too many times for example...and you're eating precious time. The editor crashed? Well that mistake cost you a few more minutes. In my case, the worst slowdown was a prefab instancing bug which took 10-15 minutes to figure out and resolve.

The challenge has helped me to gain a sense of both where I'm at and what I'm actually capable of given a short time limit. Another positive outcome is that I feel more ready to take on jams that happen over a weekend like Ludum Dare. Pretty much anything on offer at the game jam databases now feels within reach.
