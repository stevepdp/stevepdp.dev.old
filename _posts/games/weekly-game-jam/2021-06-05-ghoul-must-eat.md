### Retrospective
Made for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210528170116/https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-203" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weekly Game Jam 203</a>.


#### The Idea
The jam theme was &ldquo;Eat the Enemy&rdquo;.

I like to explore antagonists and the anti-hero archetype. After some thought, I settled on the idea that the player would be the bad guy and that they would be eating the good guy.


#### What Went Wrong
I spent too long musing on features and aesthetic decisions. Most of the code went in on the final days. Particularly in the final few hours where I had to cut back and focus on quick-wins.

For example, I decided to cut back on how I represent a horde of ghouls. The plan was to present the ghoul with child ghouls following in a grid-like formation. I instead opted for displaying the number and scaling the player.


#### What Went Well
Despite it&apos;s flaws, the product has a beginning, a middle and an end. It shipped within the deadline. As one of the comments read, that’s an achievement in and of itself.

I received plenty of well-meaning feedback and feature requests.


#### Lessons Learned
* If allowed, prepare the game&apos;s scaffolding in advance.
* Focus on the gameplay. Leave pixel art and aesthetics till the end.
* Test exports throughout to catch issues early.
* It doesn’t matter what you <em>intended</em> to make, you will be judged on what you shipped.
