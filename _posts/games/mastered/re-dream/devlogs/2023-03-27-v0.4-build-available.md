The <a href="https://stevepdp.itch.io/re-dream" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">v0.4 build of Re:Dream</a> is now available on Itch along with a <a href="https://forms.gle/hpmi8qCiKwp7NMb9A" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new questionnaire</a>.

This build introduces a large new level featuring multiple challenge areas, juiced platforming and a story journal. With each puzzle piece the player collects, a journal notification will appear. At this point, you can open the journal and read a chapter of narrative.

As a non-writer, it was especially tricky trying to put a story together. With ChatGPT in mind, I decided to utilise it for the story here. The trick with ChatGPT, particularly with regards to storytelling for games, is to give it ALL the context of what the player is doing/experiencing. You should frequently remind it of the prior context and then batch responses so as to avoid network errors. It helped to request first-person perspective responses too.
