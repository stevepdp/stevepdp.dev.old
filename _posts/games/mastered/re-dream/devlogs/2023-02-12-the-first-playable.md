I recently shared a <a href="https://stevepdp.itch.io/re-dream" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first playable of Re:Dream</a> to Itch.io along with a <a href="https://forms.gle/Qy5KRdanYtnbK6Nr8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">questionaire to help gather feedback</a>.

It is an early development build and as such has plenty of bugs and little in the way of polish.
