### Retrospective
Made in two weeks for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/vaporjam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VaporJam</a>.


#### The Idea
The theme was open-ended: &ldquo;make a vaporwave-themed game&rdquo;. With the ongoing lockdown in England, I&apos;ve been feeling nostalgic of better times. I decided that for this game it would be fun to centre a game around a particularly nostalgic period of my life.

While musing on the theme, I was re-watching some George Carlin specials. His &ldquo;Shopping and Eating&rdquo; routine for some reason sat at the forefront of my mind. So I decided that this would be <em>a super-chill exploration</em> of the late 90&apos;s through the lens of a shopping mall.

The idea requires me to recall details of particular things I was exploring or doing at the time. As I age, I&apos;m noticing that these things are becoming more like vague recollections. In some circumstances, I have to correct myself. So there&apos;s an aspect to the game where a voice breaks in to correct or provide more context.

You are to populate your inventory with one of each type of item at the mall. A game, a music cd, a film and so on. Some memories are accurate, some have been misrecalled and are of things I encountered later in life.

It&apos;s a strange one, but I hope it makes sense and triggers some nostalgic feelings.


#### What went well
* It uses Unity&apos;s new input system. Full controller support!
* Text renders in real-time throughout.
* There is many in-game BGMs.
* To address a player&apos;s loud audio concern, there&apos;s a content warning.
* CC attributions are a dedicated menu item.
* A dialog system with optional outcomes.
* It&apos;s more expansive than prior efforts and as such I&apos;ve included a mini-map.


#### What went wrong
This one really suffered from scope creep. 


#### What I learned
With each jam, I&apos;ve aimed to learn at least one new thing. With this one however, there were too many of those things.

For future jams, I&apos;ll make sure to limit it to one significant new thing each time.
