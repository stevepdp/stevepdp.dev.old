"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" or so the saying goes...

I care about privacy. So much so infact that I have zero interest in collecting data either on this website or for any game projects that I release in a personal capacity. As such, there are no cookies, no trackers and no forms with which you might submit information.

I offer a public email address voluntarily with the purpose of receiving website or project-related queries. By sending email to this address, you volunteer your own email address and any other information included in the email you send.

There are links to external websites throughout the website. Please note that clicking on one of these links will take you to another website which likely does include some tracking. Please refer to the privacy policy of those specific external websites for more information.

This website is hosted by Neocites. It's possible that Neocities may log basic visitor information such as your IP address, browser version, device type etc for the purpose of serving the content and improving their own service.

If you have any questions regarding this policy, please reach out to me at hello@stevepdp.dev.
