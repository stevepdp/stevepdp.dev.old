"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" or so the saying goes...

I care about privacy. So much so infact that I have zero interest in collecting data in any game that I release in a personal capacity. As such, Rad Rocket does not ask for any device permissions and there are no cookies, trackers or forms with which you might submit information.

Rad Rocket was developed in the GameMaker Studio 2 game engine and it is offered for free with no in-app purchases or other means of monetisation. Every effort has been made to ensure that analytics and bug reporting features have been disabled prior to building.

I offer a public email address voluntarily on the app listing with the purpose of receiving Rad Rocket-related queries. By sending email to this address, you volunteer your own email address and any other information included in the email you send.

There are no clickable links to external websites within the app.

If you have any questions regarding this policy, please reach out to me at hello@stevepdp.dev.
