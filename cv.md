<h3>Bio</h3>
I have 2-3 years experience developing games in <strong>C# &amp; Unity</strong>. In preparation for a new career in the industry, I recently participated in a gameplay programming bootcamp with Mastered, building 3D projects guided by technical mentors and career coaches. With the continuing support of their creative network, I now seek a full-time remote-working position where I can hone my skills, make hit games and climb the ranks of the gameplay programmer discipline.

<h3>Highlights</h3>
* 16+ weeks major project development with Unity-authorised technical mentoring at Mastered.
* Also with Mastered, 4x &ldquo;monthly creator challenges&rdquo;, each simulating a live production scenario.
* Independent participation in 8+ game jams â€“ playables: <a href="https://stevepdp.itch.io" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stevepdp.itch.io</a>, source code: <a href="https://github.com/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">github.com/stevepdp</a>.
* 8+ years prior professional and creative experience in Web, Linux and Open Source technologies.
* Foundation Degree in Business Computing.
