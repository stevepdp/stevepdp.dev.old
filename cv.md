This is a public cut of my CV with redactions for privacy. 

Alternatively available <a href="/assets/doc/cv-public-202309052236.pdf" target="_blank">in PDF format</a>.

<h3>Brief</h3>
I have 3 years experience with C# & Unity. This is evidenced by a <a href="/games.html" title="To the Games category">portfolio of games</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Source code on GitHub" target="_blank">public source code</a> and a range of <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Stephen Pearce on LinkedIn" target="_blank">digital certificates</a>.

To improve my case for breaking-in to the industry, this year I participated in a gameplay programming bootcamp with Mastered, guided by Unity-authorised mentors and career coaches. Now I&apos;m seeking a permanent position where I can hone my T-shaped skills, contribute to hit games and climb the ranks of the gameplay programmer discipline.

<h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
* 16+ weeks major Unity project development at Mastered with weekly one-to-one mentoring. Also four monthly creator challenges, each simulating a live production scenario. Utilising Slack, Zoom & Trello for communication.
* Independent participation in 8+ game jams, with optimised builds playable either natively or via web browser.
* 11+ digital certificates in games business, design and development. Recently: C, C++ and Unity Learn pathways.
* Actively learning C++ and Unreal Engine, utilising trusted courseware on Udemy.
