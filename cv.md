<h3>Bio</h3>
I have 2-3 years experience developing games in <strong>C# &amp; Unity</strong>. In preparation for a new career in the industry, I recently participated in a gameplay programming bootcamp with Mastered, designing and building 3D projects guided by technical mentors and career coaches. With the support of their creative network, I now seek a full-time onsite/hybrid-working role where I can hone my T-shaped skills, contribute to landmark games and climb the ranks of my discipline.

<h3>Highlights</h3>
* 16+ weeks major project development with Unity-authorised technical mentoring at Mastered.
* Also with Mastered: 4x &ldquo;monthly creator challenges&rdquo;, each simulating a live production scenario.
* Independent participation in 8+ game jams – playables: <a href="https://stevepdp.itch.io" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stevepdp.itch.io</a>, source code: <a href="https://github.com/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">github.com/stevepdp</a>.
* 8+ years prior professional and creative experience in Web, Linux and Open Source technologies.

<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
<u>Flexible Learner</u> &mdash; Utilising the full range of modern web resources, digital courses and AI-driven LLMs such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, I am very comfortable self-learning, even in those areas where I have little to no experience.
