### About

Hi. I make games and I'm interested in their design and programming.

Connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, play the games on <a href="https://stevepdp.itch.io" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Itch</a> and explore the source at <a href="https://github.com/stevepdp" rel="me nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
