### About
Hi! I'm a gameplay programmer on Unity. My focus is on big-screen 2D and 3D experiences that delight players! I'm currently participating in a bootcamp: "Real-Time 3D Skills Bootcamp - Gameplay Programmer (Unity)" with Mastered. With the first phase now wrapping up, I am seeking a remote-working, full-time position in the industry.
